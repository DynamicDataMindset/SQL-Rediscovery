# SQL Rediscovery ‚Äì Mpumalanga Sessions

I studied SQL during my Diploma and Advanced Diploma in Applications Development at the University of Mpumalanga. This project is part of my personal revision‚Äîto see if I still remember SQL queries and core concepts.

To test myself, I asked ChatGPT to generate a sample table in CSV format. I then uploaded it into Copilot, which generated 20 SQL practice questions for me to work through, ranging from easy to advanced.

All queries were executed using **SQLite**, and this README documents the final queries, my debugging steps, and learning insights for each. I‚Äôm currently branching into **Data Analytics and Data Science**, where SQL is essential‚Äîso this is the first batch of revision queries. More are coming as I level up.

## üìÅ Table Schema (from CSV import)

- `first_name`
- `last_name`
- `salary`
- `hire_date` (`YYYY-MM-DD`)
- `department`
- `location`
- `job_title`

## üéì SQL Practice Questions and Solutions

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Show all employees

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees;
```
Basic full-table exploration.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Show first and last names of employees
```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM employees; 
```
Focuses on identification columns only

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Show employees hired before 2020
```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, hire_date
FROM employees
WHERE hire_date < '2020-01-01';
```
üõ† Debug Insight:
Originally tried  `'2020/01/01' `, which didn‚Äôt match SQLite‚Äôs expected  `YYYY-MM-DD ` format. I corrected this by inspecting the data with:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT hire_date FROM employees;
```
### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Show employees with salary greater than 80,000
```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 80000;
```
