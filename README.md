# SQL Rediscovery ‚Äì Mpumalanga Sessions

I studied SQL during my Diploma and Advanced Diploma in Applications Development at the University of Mpumalanga. This project is part of my personal revision‚Äîto see if I still remember SQL queries and core concepts.

To test myself, I asked ChatGPT to generate a sample table in CSV format. I then uploaded it into Copilot, which generated 20 SQL practice questions for me to work through, ranging from easy to advanced.

All queries were executed using **SQLite**, and this README documents the final queries, my debugging steps, and learning insights for each. I‚Äôm currently branching into **Data Analytics and Data Science**, where SQL is essential‚Äîso this is the first batch of revision queries. More are coming as I level up.
